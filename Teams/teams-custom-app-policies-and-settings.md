# Manage custom and sideloaded apps in Teams admin center

Microsoft Teams allows developers within your organization to build, test, and distribute Teams apps for organization's internal users. Such apps are called custom apps or Line of Business (LOB) apps. Admins control the rollout of and access to custom apps using app policies and admin center settings.

After you allow the use of a custom app, your users can find it by selecting **Built for your org** in the left navigation of Teams store.

As a Teams admin, you use custom app settings to control who in your organization can upload custom apps to Microsoft Teams. Admins decide which users can upload custom apps using app setup policy. After you edit the setup policy for custom apps, it takes a few hours for changes to take effect. You must be a Global Admin or Teams Administrator to manage these policies. Admins and team owners can configure a specific team in your organization to allow or disallow addition of custom apps to the team.

## Understand custom apps and sideloading

Your organization may commission the creation of custom apps for your org-specific requirements. Custom apps may be developed within your organization or by app developers outside the organization.

The following are the methods to make custom apps available in your organization's Store, to a team, or for a few users.

| Method to upload custom app | Who does it | App approval and availability | Control the upload option | Potential use case |
|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Custom app submission by user** | Any user via Teams client | Available to permitted users after admin approval | Submit option is available to all users and can't be turned off. Admins can disapprove any submission. | Any user can submit app from within Teams that are available to the permitted org users after approval. |
| **Custom app upload by admin**    | Global or Teams admin via Teams admin center | No approval required; immediate availability | Available to all admins; can't disable. | Admins upload custom apps that are received outside Teams to be used by the permitted users. |
| **Sideloading by user**           | Any user in Teams client | No admin involvement or approvals when a user uploads | Admin controls which users can sideload. | App makers test their custom app in personal context or with a few users before distribution without constant admin intervention. App makers use an app with a limited audience without distributing the app to org's Teams catalog. |

As an admin, you can disallow sideloading for any or all users in our organization. If you disallow sideloading, the app creators can still test their apps by [creating a separate test tenant](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant). Once custom app development is complete, app creators request admins to distribute their custom app to the users. For details, see [how to publish a custom app](/microsoftteams/upload-custom-apps). As an admin, you allow (or block) the use a custom app for all users or for specific users.

## Allow users to upload custom apps

Microsoft Teams provides granular control over who can add custom apps to a team. To control if custom apps can be added to a team or not, admins and team owners use the following two settings. These settings don't affect the ability to block third-party apps.

* [**App setup policy**](#app-setup-policy-settings-for-custom-apps): A setting named **Upload custom apps** in the app setup policy determines which users in an organization are allowed to upload custom apps.
* [**Allow members to upload custom apps**](#team-setting-for-custom-app): This setting in each team determines if users of a team can upload custom apps or not.

| Setting in a team | Setting in app setup policy | Affects who can upload custom apps   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Off               | Off                         | No user                              |
| Off               | On                          | Only Team owners                     |
| On                | Off                         | No user                              |
| On                | On                          | Anybody                              |

### App setup policy settings for custom apps

To configure setup policy for custom apps, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Teams admin center and access **Teams apps** > **[Setup policies](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/app-setup)**.
1. Perform one of the following steps:

   * Select **Add** and provide a name and description for the policy. It creates a new policy.
   * Select an existing policy and select **Edit**.

1. Turn on or turn off the **Upload custom apps** option.
1. Select **Save**.
1. [Apply the policy to users](assign-policies-users-and-groups.md#assign-a-policy-to-individual-users) so that those users can upload custom apps.

To allow use of custom apps by an organization's users, see [org-wide app settings](manage-apps.md#manage-org-wide-app-settings).

### Team setting for custom app

To configure the custom apps related setting in a team, follow these steps as a team owner:

1. In Teams, go to a team, and select **More options ...** > **Manage team**.
1. Select **Settings** and expand **Member permissions**.
1. Select or clear the **Allow members to upload custom apps** check box.

## Allow your users to use custom apps

The **Allow interaction with custom apps** org-wide custom app setting in the Teams admin center applies to everyone in your organization and governs whether they can interact with custom apps or not. To configure the org-wide custom app setting, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Teams admin center and access **Teams apps** > **[Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps)**.
1. Select **Org-wide app settings**.
1. Under **Custom apps**, turn on or turn off **Allow interaction with custom apps**.

## Understand how all the custom app settings work together

This table summarizes the custom app settings and how the settings work together. The combined effect controls who in your organization can upload custom apps to Teams.

|Org-wide custom app setting |Team custom app setting |User custom app settings | Effect  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Off    | Off    | Off     |Interaction with all custom apps is blocked for your organization. Only a Teams Administrator or a Global Administrator can upload a custom app. You can use PowerShell to remove the custom app.   |
| Off     | Off     | On        |Interaction with all custom apps is blocked for your organization. Only a Teams Administrator or a Global Administrator can upload a custom app. You can use PowerShell to remove the custom app.         |
| Off    | On        | Off        |Interaction with all custom apps is blocked for your organization. Only a Teams Administrator or a Global Administrator can upload a custom app. You can use Windows PowerShell to delete custom apps.         |
| Off    | On      | On       |Interaction with all custom apps is blocked for your organization. Only a Teams Administrator or a Global Administrator can upload a custom app. You can use PowerShell to remove the custom app.         |
| On    | Off       | Off         |  The user can't upload custom apps.      |
| On     | Off       | On         | If the user is a team owner, they can upload custom apps to the team. If the user isn't a team owner, they can't upload custom apps to the team. The user can upload custom apps in the personal context.     |
| On     | On     | Off         | The user can't upload custom apps.       |
| On    | On        | On        | The user can upload custom apps to the team, regardless of whether the user is a team owner. The user can upload custom apps in the personal context.       |

Consider a scenario where you want to allow only team owners to upload custom apps to specific teams and users to use it. To accomplish this result, implement the following settings:

* Turn on the **Allow interaction with custom apps** setting in the Microsoft Teams admin center.
* Turn off the **Allow members to upload custom apps** for every team to which you want to restrict access.
* Create and assign a custom policy in app setup policy in admin center with the **Upload custom apps** setting turned on and assign the policy to the team owners.
