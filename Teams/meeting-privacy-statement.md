# Customize your organization's privacy statement in the meeting join experience

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️Meetings ✖️Webinars ✖️Town halls

Microsoft Teams enables businesses to schedule and conduct business-to-customer engagements with customers, clients, and other people outside your organization as well as with employees within your organization. When attendees join Teams meetings, especially in external engagements, there's a need to inform them of the organization's privacy statement.

You can customize and display a privacy statement link in the Teams meeting join experience to ensure attendees are aware of your organization's privacy guidelines before they join a meeting.

## Set your organization's privacy statement

Global admins can configure the privacy statement for your organization in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** > **Org Settings**, and then select the **Security & privacy** tab.
1. Choose **Privacy profile**.

1. Enter the URL of your organization's privacy statement and the email address of your privacy contact, and then select **Save**.

## Meeting join experience

After it's set up, the privacy statement link is shown to attendees in the lower-left corner of the meeting join experience. When internal or external attendees join using the Teams meeting link in the meeting invitation or from the Teams or Outlook calendar, they can go the privacy statement link to view your organization's privacy statement.
