# Customize your organization's privacy statement in the meeting join experience

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️Meetings ✖️Webinars ✖️Town halls

## Overview

Microsoft Teams enables businesses to schedule and conduct business-to-customer engagements with customers, clients, and other people outside your organization as well as with employees within your organization. When attendees join Teams meetings, especially in external engagements, there's a need to inform them of the organization's privacy statement.

You can customize and display a privacy statement link on the meeting prejoin screen to ensure attendees are aware of your organization's privacy guidelines before they join a meeting.

Global admins can set the privacy statement for your organization in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** > **Org Settings**, and then select the **Security & privacy** tab.
1. Choose **Privacy profile**.

1. Enter the URL of your organization's privacy statement and the email address of your privacy contact, and then select **Save**.

After it's set up, the privacy statement link is shown to attendees on the meeting prejoin screen. When internal or external attendees join using the Teams meeting link in the meeting invitation or from the Teams or Outlook calendar, they can see the link to the privacy statement in the lower-left corner of the join experience.
