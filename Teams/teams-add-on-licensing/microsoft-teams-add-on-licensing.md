# Microsoft Teams add-on licenses

Before reading this article, see [Manage user access to Teams](user-access.md) for information about Teams licenses.  
**AGREE THIS NEEDS A NEW TITLE!**

This article is about Teams add-on licenses, which let you add capabilities for those users in your organization who need them. The add-on licenses available to you depend on the Microsoft Teams plan you have.  Typically, you buy one add-on license for each user who will use it.  **TRUE?**

## Overview of add-on licenses

The following table provides an overview of the add-on licenses that you can add to your Teams subscription. For example, you might want to add an Audio Conferencing license so that users can dial in to meetings using their phones. Or, your organization might decide to deploy Teams Phone, which provides PBX functionality, with an additional option for connecting to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) for external calling.

|License|Description|
|-------|-----------|
| **Microsoft Teams Premium** | Microsoft Teams Premium is an add-on license that allows organizations with Microsoft 365 subscriptions and Teams licenses to enhance their Teams experience with added benefits, such as personalized and intelligent meetings, enhanced meeting protection, and advanced management and reporting capabilities. <br/> <br/>For more information about the Teams Premium add-on license, see [Microsoft Teams Premium licensing](licensing-enhance-teams.md). |
| **Teams Phone Standard** | [Teams Phone](../what-is-phone-system-in-office-365.md) is a hosted telephone service that gives you call control and Private Branch Exchange (PBX) capabilities. Teams Phone Standard licenses give you all Teams Phone capabilities like cloud voicemail, call park, call forwarding, auto attendants, call queues, call transfer, and caller ID. <br/><br/>Teams Phone options are described in more detail later in this article. |
| **Microsoft Teams Calling Plans** | If your users need to call phone numbers outside your organization, you can purchase [Microsoft Teams Calling Plans](../calling-plans-for-office-365.md) to connect to PSTN phone numbers. With this option, Microsoft is your PSTN provider. <br/><br/>Calling Plan options are described in more detail later in this article. |
| **Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle** | The Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle provides both Teams Phone PBX capabilities and a Microsoft Calling Plan for connectivity to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). |
| **Communication Credits** | Communication Credits provide a monthly pool of minutes that can be used for PSTN phone calls, if all your Calling Plan minutes get used before the beginning of the next month. If you want toll-free numbers for Audio Conferencing, auto attendants, or call queues, you'll need to [set up Communications Credits](../set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md). |
| **Audio Conferencing** | Audio Conferencing enables people in your organization to use a phone instead of their computer to call in to a Teams meeting. <br/><br/>Note that Audio Conferencing does not require a Teams Phone license. |
| **Microsoft Teams Rooms** | Microsoft Teams Rooms is an additional Microsoft Teams product that brings video, audio, and content sharing to conference rooms. <br/> <br/>Teams Rooms Basic is a free license for up to 25 rooms that delivers core meeting and management functionality for all Teams Rooms devices. <br/> <br/>Teams Rooms Pro brings enhanced meeting experiences and advanced management and security to help you operate your devices at scale and enable inclusive hybrid meetings. <br/> <br/>For more information, see [Teams Meeting Room Licensing](../rooms/rooms-licensing.md). |
| **Microsoft Teams Shared Devices** | Many organizations require flexible workplace solutions as they shift to hybrid work scenarios. The Microsoft Teams Shared Devices license is designed to support hybrid work by allowing offices to designate devices as shared devices, including common area phones, Teams displays for hot-desks, and Teams panels for meeting spaces. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams Shared Devices licensing](teams-shared-device-license.md). |

[!INCLUDE [EEA Teams licensing notice](../includes/eea-teams-licensing.md)]

## Audio Conferencing license

The Audio Conferencing license enables people in your organization to use a phone instead of their computer to call in to a Teams meeting--also called PSTN conferencing for meetings.

To find out whether Audio Conferencing is available in your country or region, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). For pricing info, see [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799762). 

For users who schedule or lead meetings with attendees who need to call in using a phone, you'll need to [set up Audio Conferencing](../set-up-audio-conferencing-in-teams.md). 

You can also choose to use a third-party operator for your Audio Conferencing numbers if your current operator is part of the Microsoft Operator Connect program. For more information, see [Plan for Operator Connect Conferencing](../operator-connect-conferencing-plan.md).

## Teams Phone with PSTN connectivity license options

Most Microsoft 365 plans allow Teams users to make peer-to-peer calls within your organization using VoIP technology. However, you may want to add different licenses for setting up Teams Phone PBX capabilities and connecting to the PSTN for external calling.

Teams Phone requires a separate add-on license. For users to make and receive external calls using the PSTN, you'll need to choose a PSTN connectivity option as well. Some PSTN connectivity options require an additional license; some do not.

This article introduces the various Teams Phone license options. For detailed information about Teams Phone PBX features, see [Teams Phone features](../here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system.md). For information about which voice solution is best for your organization, see [Plan your voice solution](../cloud-voice-landing-page.md) and [PSTN connectivity options](../pstn-connectivity.md).

- **Teams Phone with Calling Plans** - Available as a Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle or as separate licenses: one for Teams Phone plus an additional Calling Plan license. There are Domestic Calling Plans, International Calling Plans, and Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plans. To find out whether Teams Calling Plans is available in your country or region, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).

- **Teams Phone with Operator Connect** - Requires Teams Phone license. See [Plan for Operator Connect](../operator-connect-plan.md).
- **Teams Phone with Operator Connect for India** - Requires licenses from your chosen PSTN carrier in India. For more information, see [Plan Operator Connect for India](../operator-connect-india-plan.md).
- **Teams Phone Mobile** - Requires Teams Phone and Teams Phone Mobile licenses. For more information, see [Plan for Teams Phone Mobile](../operator-connect-mobile-plan.md).
- **Direct Routing** - Requires a Teams Phone license. For more information, see [Plan for Direct Routing](../direct-routing-plan.md).
- **Shared Calling** - Requires a Teams Phone license. For more information, see [Plan for Shared Calling](../shared-calling-plan.md).
