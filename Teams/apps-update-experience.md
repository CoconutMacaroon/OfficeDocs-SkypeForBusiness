# Role of an admin to upgrade Teams apps to a newer version

Teams app developers provide newer version of their apps to enhance the experience of the users. Depending on the organization settings, either Teams administrators or users or both can consent to the apps. When you or your users add an app to Teams for the first time, you or the users consent to the permissions. When the app updates, it only requires consent again, if the new version has more functionality or requests more information within your organization.

As a Teams administrator, you can update Teams apps to help the users get the latest version of apps by performing one of the following tasks:

* When a new app version is available in Teams store, allow users to update it.
* When your developer submits a new version of a custom app, [update or approve the submission](#custom-apps) and allow users to update it.

## Conditions when an app updates and requires consent

Apps update on their own if there's no change in functionality or request for organization's data. When one or more of the following changes are made to an app, it doesn't update on its own. Users can provide consent when they try to use the app for the first time.

* Add a bot. Change the ID of the bot using the `botId` property.
* Change the `isNotificationOnly` property of an existing bot that may change the bot's notifications.
* Change `SupportsCalling`, `SupportsVideo`, and `SupportsFiles` properties of an existing bot to add capability to call, play video, and upload or download files.
* Change parameters in the `webApplicationInfo` in the manifest file.
* Add or remove permissions in authorization.
* Add or remove a messaging extension, group tab, connector, or channel.

When creating the new version of an app, the developer can change the above values in the [app manifest file](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema). Any of these changes lead to a change in app permissions. Hence, an update requires admin approval.

Teams simplifies the app update experience for its users by requiring their consent for new app versions only once. When a user consents, Teams updates the app in the chats, channels, and meetings where the user is added. Users don't need to update the app separately in each context.

> [!NOTE]
> When any of the above mentioned changes are done in a version of an app, then you as an admin can't consent on behalf of the users. After such changes, to update their app, users must individually provide their consent. However, the users can provide their own consent only if Azure Active Directory admin [allows users to consent](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent?pivots=portal).

## Contexts in which apps upgrade

A user can use an app in more than one context in Teams. When a user consents, the app is updated in their chats, channels, and meetings but only in the contexts where the previous version of the app was added. Users don't need to update the app separately in each context.

* **Personal app** context - When a user is using an app in their private workspace.

* **Tab app** context - When a user opens an app from a tab within a team, meeting, or group chat.

* **Bot app** context - When a bot app initiates update in a chat with users.

## Custom apps

Custom apps that are created and deployed within your organization are available to the users on your organization. Teams admin updates a custom app to its new version in one of the following ways:

* If developers send the app package to you, then upload it to your organization's app catalog in Teams.
* If developers submit the app via Teams, then review and approve the request for the app to be available in your organization's app catalog in Teams.

For more information, see [how admins manage custom apps](teams-custom-app-policies-and-settings.md).

For custom apps to update, after you upload the new version of the app to Teams, users must individually provide their consent if it's required.

## Considerations for app upgrades

* If an app's newer version doesn't require any new permissions, then it updates to the new version automatically.

* For updated apps, Teams administrators can't consent on behalf of the users. Users must individually provide their consent if it's required. Azure AD admin must [allow users to consent](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent?pivots=portal).

* A team owner can add an app in a team and view the update option when there's an available app update. It can be done from the **Manage team** page in their Teams client.

   :::image type="content" source="media/manage-teams-owner.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Apps option in the Manage team page that teams owners can view.":::

* When an app is updated in a team, all team members can access the updated app. However, team members must still give their consent to use the same app in their other contexts.

* After updating in a context, the app automatically updates only in the contexts that the user is a member of and the previous version of the app was added. The app isn't updated in teams and groups that the user isn't a part of. The new version of the app isn't added to teams or groups where the app wasn't originally added.

* Teams admin can't forcibly update an app for a user if the user doesn't provide consent to an app.
