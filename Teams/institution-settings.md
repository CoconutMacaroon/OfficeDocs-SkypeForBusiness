# Set up AI content recommendations

Institution settings in educational contexts are crucial for administrators to tailor and oversee their digital environments effectively. These settings encompass user management with role-based access control, curriculum and course configuration, communication tools for efficient interaction, and robust data privacy measures to comply with established standards. Additionally, they include assessments on grading systems, advanced reporting, and analytics for informed decision making. This integration with external customization services enhances options for branding. By meticulously managing these aspects, educational institutions can enhance administrative efficiency, improve the learning experience, and maintain high security and compliance standards. It fosters an optimized educational environment.

## Enable AI for Educators setting

The AI content recommendations control allows administrators to disable (or enable) access for educators, the generative AI features that are integrated with the Teams Education Applications. It's enabled by default and allows use of generative AI enhancements for the following education applications: Assignments, Classwork, Reading Progress and Insights.

Navigation: **Teams admin Center** > **Education** > **Institution Settings**.
