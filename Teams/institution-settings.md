# Set up AI content recommendations in an institution

Institution settings in educational contexts are crucial for administrators to tailor and oversee their digital environments effectively. These settings encompass user management with role-based access control, curriculum and course configuration, communication tools for efficient interaction, and robust data privacy measures to comply with established standards. Additionally, they include assessments on grading systems, advanced reporting, and analytics for informed decision making. This integration with external customization services enhances options for branding. By meticulously managing these aspects, educational institutions can enhance administrative efficiency, improve the learning experience, and maintain high security and compliance standards. It fosters an optimized educational environment.

Using this functionality, educators use AI to generate content such as reading passages, comprehension questions, rubrics, assignment instructions, and class module outlines. It allows the use of generative AI enhancements for Assignments, Classwork, Reading Progress, and Insights apps.

## Enable AI for Educators

The generative AI feature integrates with the Teams Education Applications and is enabled by default. To disable or re-enable the AI recommendations, follow these steps:

1. In Teams admin center, access **Education** > [**Institution settings**](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/education/institution-settings).

1. Enable or disable the **AI content recommendations** and select **Save**.
