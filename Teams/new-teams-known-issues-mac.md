# New Teams for the Mac: Known issues 

There are a few known issues we're working on.


### Offline

**Issue**: Offline message edits, delete, and reactions functionality is currently not supported.</br>
**Workaround:**  Users can still send messages offline in new Teams for Mac.  However for full functionality, use classic Teams.

### Meeting Join

**Issue**: Users aren't muted despite the tooltip message that says they are.  In large meetings of over 600+ attendees the microphone was still active. </br>
**Workaround:**  Manually mute the call.

**Issue:**  During call transfer, if the call ends prematurely then the banner is not updated correctly.</br>
**Workaround:**  Being investigated. No current workaround.
